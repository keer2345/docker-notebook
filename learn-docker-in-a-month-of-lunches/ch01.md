# 1.1   Why containers will take over the world
## 1.1.1   Migrating apps to the cloud
There used to be two options for migrating an app to the cloud:
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS).

Neither option was great. Your choice was basically a compromise – choose PaaS and run a project to migrate all the pieces of your application to the relevant managed service from the cloud. That's a difficult project and it locks you in to a single cloud, but it does get you lower running costs. The alternative is IaaS where you spin up a virtual machine for each component of your application. You get portability across clouds but much higher running costs


The original options for migrating to the cloud - use IaaS and run lots of inefficient VMs with high monthly cost, or use PaaS and get lower running costs but spend more time on the migration

</div>

Docker offers a third option without the compromise. You migrate each part of your application to a container, and then you can run the whole application in containers using Azure Kubernetes Service or Amazon's Elastic Container Service, or on your own Docker cluster in the datacenter.

## 1.1.2   Modernizing legacy apps
Decomposing a monolith into a distributed application without rewriting the whole project. All the components run in Docker containers, and a routing component decides whether requests are fulfilled by the monolith or a new microservice.

## 1.1.3   Building New Cloud Native Apps
Docker helps you get your existing apps to the cloud, whether they’re distributed apps or monoliths. If you have monoliths, Docker helps you break them up into modern architectures, whether you’re running in the cloud or in the data center. And brand-new projects built on cloud native principles are greatly accelerated with Docker.

The [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/) characterizes these new architectures as using "an open source software stack to deploy applications as microservices, packaging each part into its own container, and dynamically orchestrating those containers to optimize resource utilization".

Figure 1.4 shows a typical architecture for a new microservices application – this is a demo application from the community which you can find on GitHub at https://github.com/microservices-demo:

**Cloud native applications are built with microservice architectures where every component runs in a container**

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://dpzbhybb2pdcj.cloudfront.net/stoneman/v-1/Figures/Images_01-03_4.jpg">
</div>

It's a great sample application if you want to see how microservices are actually implemented. Each component owns its own data and exposes it through an API. The front end is a web application which consumes all the API services. The demo application uses various programming languages and different database technologies. But every component has a Dockerfile to package it, and the whole application is defined in a Docker Compose file.

## 1.1.4   Technical Innovation – Serverless And More
A single cluster of servers running Docker can run every type of application, and you build, deploy and manage them all in the same way no matter what architecture or technology stack they use

</div>

Serverless is all about containers. The goal of serverless is for developers to write function code, then push it to a service, and that service builds and packages the code. When consumers use the function the service starts an instance of the function to action the request. There are no build servers, pipelines or production servers to manage, it's all taken care of by the platform.

Under the covers, all the cloud serverless options use Docker to package the code, and containers to run functions. But functions in the cloud aren’t portable – you can’t take your AWS Lambda function and run it in Azure, because there isn't an open standard for serverless. If you want serverless without cloud lock-in, or if you’re running in the data center, you can host your own platform in Docker using Nuclio, OpenFaaS or Fn Project – which are all popular open-source serverless frameworks.

Other major innovations like machine learning, blockchain and IoT benefit from the consistent packaging and deployment model of Docker. You’ll find the main projects all deploy to Docker Hub – TensorFlow and Hyperledger are good examples. And IoT is particularly interesting, as Docker have partnered with Arm to make containers the default runtime for edge and IoT devices.

## 1.1.5   Digital transformation with DevOps

DevOps aims to bring agility to software deployment and maintenance by having a single team own the whole application lifecycle, combining "dev" and "ops" into one deliverable. DevOps is mainly about cultural change, and it really can take organizations from huge quarterly releases, to small daily deployments. But it's hard to do that without changing the technologies the team uses.

Operators may have a background in tools like Bash, Nagios, PowerShell and System Center. Developers work in Make, Maven, NuGet and MSBuild. It’s difficult to bring a team together when they don't use common technologies, which is where Docker really helps. You can underpin your DevOps transformation with the move to containers, and suddenly the whole team is working with Dockerfiles and Docker Compose files, speaking the same languages and working with the same tools.

It goes further too. There's a powerful framework for implementing DevOps called CALMS – Culture, Automation, Lean, Metrics and Sharing. Docker works on all those initiatives: automation is central to running containers, distributed apps are built on lean principles, metrics from production apps and from the deployment process can be easily published and Docker Hub is all about sharing and not duplicating effort.

# 1.2   Is this book for you?

The goal of this book is to teach you how to use Docker, so I don’t go into much detail on how Docker itself works under the hood. I won't talk in detail about `containerd` or lower level details like Linux `cgroups` and `namespaces` or the Windows Host Compute Service. If you want the internals, Manning’s Docker in Action is a great choice.

The samples in this book are all cross-platform, so you can work along using Windows, Mac or Linux – including Arm processors, so you can use a Raspberry Pi too.

Lastly this book is specifically on Docker – so when it comes to production deployment I’ll be using Docker Swarm, the clustering technology built into Docker.

# 1.3   How to use this book
## 1.3.1   Your learning journey
## 1.3.2   Try-it-nows

Every chapter of the book has guided exercises for you to complete. The source code for the book is all on GitHub at https://github.com/sixeyed/diamol - you’ll clone that when you set up your lab environment, and use it for all the sample commands, which have you building and running apps in containers.

## 1.3.3   Hands-on labs
## 1.3.4   Additional resources

The main place to look further into the topics from the book is Docker’s own documentation at https://docs.docker.com, which covers everything from setting up the Docker engine, through syntax for Dockerfiles and Docker Compose, to Docker Swarm and Docker’s Enterprise product range.

Docker is a popular topic on social media too, Docker posts daily on Twitter and Facebook and you’ll find a lot of my content out there too. You can follow me on Twitter [@EltonStoneman](https://twitter.com/EltonStoneman), my blog is [blog.sixeyed.com](https://blog.sixeyed.com), and I post YouTube videos at [youtube.com/eltonstoneman](http://youtube.com/eltonstoneman).

# 1.4   Creating your lab environment
## 1.4.1   Install Docker
- [Install Docker Desktop on Windows 10](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Install Docker Desktop on Mac OS X](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Install Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox)
- [Install Docker Community Edition and Docker Compose](https://get.docker.com/)
- [Install Docker on Windows Server or Linux Server distributions](https://hub.docker.com/search/?q=&type=edition&offering=enterprise)

## 1.4.2   Verify your Docker setup

There are several components which make up the Docker platform, but for this book you just need to verify that Docker is running and Docker Compose is installed.

First check Docker itself with the `docker version` command:
```
PS>docker version
 Client: Docker Engine - Community
  Version:           19.03.0-beta3
  API version:       1.40
  Go version:        go1.12.4
  Git commit:        c55e026
  Built:             Thu Apr 25 19:05:10 2019   
  OS/Arch:           windows/amd64
  Experimental:      true
  
 Server: Docker Engine - Community
  Engine:
   Version:          19.03.0-beta3
   API version:      1.40 (minimum version 1.24)
   Go version:       go1.12.4
   Git commit:       c55e026
   Built:            Thu Apr 25 19:06:34 2019   
   OS/Arch:          windows/amd64
   Experimental:     true
```

Next you need to test Docker Compose, which is a separate command line that also interacts with Docker. Run `docker-compose` version to check:
```
PS>docker-compose version
 docker-compose version 1.24.0, build 0aa59064
 docker-py version: 3.7.2
 CPython version: 3.6.8
 OpenSSL version: OpenSSL 1.0.2q  20 Nov 2018
```

## 1.4.3   Download the source code for the book
The source code for this book is in a public Git repository on GitHub. If you have a Git client installed, just run:
```
git clone sixeyed/diamol
```

If you don’t have a Git client, browse to https://github.com/sixeyed/diamol and click the "Clone or download" button to download a ZIP file of the source code to your local machine, and expand the archive.

# 1.5   Being immediately effective

"Immediately effective" is another principle of the month of lunches series. In all the chapters that follow the focus is on learning skills and putting them into practice.

Every chapter starts with a short introduction to the topic, followed by try it now exercises where you put the ideas into practice using Docker. Then there’s a recap with some more detail that fills in some of the questions you may have from diving in, and lastly a hands-on lab for you to go the next stage.

All the topics center around tasks which are genuinely useful in the real world. You’ll learn how to be immediately effective with the topic during the chapter, and you’ll finish by understanding how to apply the new skill. Let’s start running some containers!
