# 6.1   Why data in containers is not permanent
Each container has its own filesystem, independent from other containers. You can run multiple containers from the same Docker image and they will all start with the same disk contents. The application can alter files in one container, and that won't affect the files in other containers - or in the image. That's straightforward to see by running a couple of containers which write data, and looking at their output.

Open a terminal session and run two containers from the same image. The application in the image writes a random number to a file in the container:

```docker
docker container run --name rn1 diamol/ch06-random-number
docker container run --name rn2 diamol/ch06-random-number
```

The Docker CLI has the `docker container cp` command to copy files between containers and the local machine. You specify the name of the container and the file path, and you can use that to copy out the generated random number files from these containers onto your host computer, so you can read the contents.

```docker
docker container cp rn1:/random/number.txt number1.txt
docker container cp rn2:/random/number.txt number2.txt

cat number1.txt
cat number2.txt
```

The container filesystem is built from image layers and a writeable layer:
