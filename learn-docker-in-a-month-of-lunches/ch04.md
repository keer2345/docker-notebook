# 4.1   Who needs a build server when you have a Dockerfile?
Everyone needs the same set of tools to build a software project:
<div align="center">

</div>

You can write a Dockerfile which scripts the deployment of all your tools, and build that into an image. Then you can use that image in your application Dockerfiles to compile the source code, and the final output is your packaged application.

Let’s start with a very simple example, because there are a couple of new things to understand in this process.

A multi-stage Dockerfile:
```
FROM diamol/base AS build-stage
RUN echo 'Building...' > /build.txt

FROM diamol/base AS test-stage
COPY --from=build-stage /build.txt /build.txt
RUN echo 'Testing...' >> /build.txt

FROM diamol/base
COPY --from=test-stage /build.txt /build.txt
CMD cat /build.txt
```
Executing a multi-stage Dockerfile:
<div align="center">
    <img src="https://dpzbhybb2pdcj.cloudfront.net/stoneman/v-1/Figures/image030.jpg">
</div>

It’s important to understand that the individual stages are isolated. You can use different base images with different sets of tools installed and run whatever commands you like. The output in the final stage will only contain what you explicitly copy in from earlier stages. If a command fails in any stage, that fails the whole build.

```
cd ch04/exercises/multi-stage
docker image build -t multi-stage .
```

<div align="center">

</div>

A multi-stage build for a Java application:

# 4.2   App walkthrough – Java source code
The source code is in the repository for the book, at the folder path [ch04/exercises/image-of-the-day](https://github.com/sixeyed/diamol/tree/master/ch04/exercises/image-of-the-day).
```
FROM diamol/maven AS builder

WORKDIR /usr/src/iotd
COPY pom.xml .
RUN mvn -B dependency:go-offline

COPY . .
RUN mvn package

# app
FROM diamol/openjdk

WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /usr/src/iotd/target/iotd-service-0.1.0.jar .

EXPOSE 80
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app/iotd-service-0.1.0.jar"]
```

The first stage is called `builder.` Here’s what happens in the builder stage:
- it uses the `diamol/maven` image as the base. That image has the OpenJDK Java development kit installed, as well as the Maven build tool
- the builder stage starts by creating a working directory in the image, and then copying in the `pom.xml` file, which is the Maven definition of the Java build
- the first `RUN` statement executes a Maven command, fetching all the application dependencies. This is an expensive operation, so it has its own step to make use of Docker layer caching. If there are new dependencies, the XML file will change and the step will run. If the dependencies haven’t changed then the layer cache is used.
- now the rest of the source code is copied in – `COPY . .` means copy all files and directories from the location where the Docker build is running, into the working directory in the image
- the last step of the builder is to run `mvn package`, which compiles and packages the application. The input is a set of Java source code files, and the output is a Java application package called a JAR file.

When this stage completes, the compiled application will exist in the builder stage filesystem. If there are any problems with the Maven build – if the network is offline and fetching dependencies fails, or if there is a coding error in the source – then the RUN instruction will fail and the whole build fails.

If the builder stage completes successfully, Docker goes on to execute the final stage which produces the application image:

- it starts from `diamol/openjdk` which is packaged with the Java 11 runtime, but none of the Maven build tools
- this stage creates a working directory and copies in the compiled JAR file from the builder stage. Maven packages the application and all its Java dependencies in this single JAR file, so this is all that’s needed from the builder
- the application is a web server which listens on port 80, so that port is exposed in the container image
- the `ENTRYPOINT` instruction is an alternative to the `CMD` instruction – it tells Docker what to do when a container is started from the image, in this case running Java with the path to the application JAR.
```
cd ch04/exercises/image-of-the-day
docker image build -t image-of-the-day .
```

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://dpzbhybb2pdcj.cloudfront.net/stoneman/v-1/Figures/image033.jpg">
</div>

You’re going to run several containers in this chapter, and they need to communicate with each other. Containers access each other across a virtual network, using the virtual IP address that Docker allocates when it creates the container. You can create and manage virtual Docker networks through the command line.

Create a Docker network for containers to communicate with each other:

```
docker network create nat
```

Run a container from the image, publishing port 80 to the host computer, and connecting to the nat network:
```
docker container run --name iotd -d -p 800:80 --network nat image-of-the-day
```

Now you can browse to http://localhost:800/image and you’ll see some JSON details about NASA’s image of the day. On the day I ran the container, the image was from a solar eclipse – figure 4.6 shows the details from my API:

# 4.3   App walkthrough – Node.js source code
There’s still a need for a multi-stage Dockerfile though, which is to optimize dependency loading. NodeJS use a tool called NPM (the Node Package Manager) to manage dependencies.

Dockerfile for building a NodeJS app with NPM:
```
FROM diamol/node AS builder

WORKDIR /src
COPY src/package.json .

RUN npm install

# app
FROM diamol/node

EXPOSE 80
CMD ["node", "server.js"]

WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /src/node_modules/ /app/node_modules/
COPY src/ .
```
- This application is another REST API. In the final application stage, the steps expose the HTTP port and specify the `node` command line as the startup command.
- The last thing is to create a working directory and copy in the application artifacts. The downloaded dependencies are copied from the builder stage, and the source code is copied from the host computer.
- The `src` folder contains the JavaScript files, including `server.js` which is the entry point started by the NodeJS process.

```
cd ch04/exercises/access-log
docker image build -t access-log .
```

Building a multi-stage Dockerfile for a NodeJS application:

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://dpzbhybb2pdcj.cloudfront.net/stoneman/v-1/Figures/image035.jpg">
</div>

Run a container from the log API image, publishing port 80 to host and connecting it to the same `nat` network:
```
docker container run --name accesslog -d -p 801:80 --network nat access-log
```

Now browse to http://localhost:801/stats and you’ll see how many logs the service has recorded:

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://dpzbhybb2pdcj.cloudfront.net/stoneman/v-1/Figures/image036.jpg">
</div>

# 4.4   App walkthrough – Go source code
Dockerfile for building a Go application from source:
```
FROM diamol/golang AS builder

COPY main.go .
RUN go build -o /server

# app
FROM diamol/base

ENV IMAGE_API_URL="http://iotd/image" \
    ACCESS_API_URL="http://accesslog/access-log"

CMD ["/web/server"]

WORKDIR web
COPY index.html .
COPY --from=builder /server .
RUN chmod +x server
```

```
cd ch04/exercises/image-gallery
docker image build -t image-gallery .
```

This time there won’t be a lot of compiler output, because Go is quiet and only writes logs when there are failures.

Building a Go application in a multi-stage Dockerfile:

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://dpzbhybb2pdcj.cloudfront.net/stoneman/v-1/Figures/image037.jpg">
</div>

Compare the Go application image size with the Go toolset image:
```
docker image ls -f reference=diamol/golang -f reference=image-gallery
```
Many Docker commands let you filter the output. This command lists all images, and filters the output to only include images with a reference of `diamol/golang` or `image-gallery` – the reference is really just the image name. When you run this you’ll see how important it is to choose the right base images for your Dockerfile stages:

```
REPOSITORY     TAG     IMAGE ID      CREATED         SIZE
 image-gallery  latest  b41869f5d153  20 minutes ago  25.3MB
 diamol/golang  latest  ad57f5c226fc  2 hours ago     774MB
```

Run the Go application image, publishing the host port and connecting to the nat network:
```
docker container run -d -p 802:80 --network nat image-gallery
```

# 4.5   Understanding multi-stage Dockerfiles
We’ve covered a lot of ground in this chapter, and I’m going to end with some key points so you’re really clear on how multi-stage Dockerfiles work, and why it’s incredibly useful to build your apps inside containers.
- The first point is about standardization.
- The second is performance.
- The final point is that multi-stage Dockerfiles let you fine-tune your build so the final application image is as lean as possible.

# 4.6   Lab

There are specific goals for this lab:
- Start by building an image using the existing Dockerfile, then optimize the Dockerfile to produce a new image
- The current image is 800MB on Linux and 5.2GB on Windows. Your optimized image should be around 15MB on Linux, or 260MB on Windows
- If you change the HTML content with the current Dockerfile, the build executes 7 steps.
- Your optimized Dockerfile should only execute a single step when you change the HTML.
