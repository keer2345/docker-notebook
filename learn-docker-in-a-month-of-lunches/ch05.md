# 5.1   Working with registries, repositories and image tags
Docker images need a name, and that name contains enough information for Docker to find the exact image you’re looking for. So far we’ve used very simple names with one or two parts, like `image-gallery` or `diamol/golang`. There are actually four parts to the full image name (which is properly called the image reference)

</div>

Docker uses a couple of defaults if you don’t provide values for parts of the image reference. The default registry is Docker Hub, the default tag is `latest`

# 5.2   Pushing your own images to Docker Hub
```
docker login
```

or
```
# using PowerShell on Windows
$dockerId=”<your-docker-id-goes-here>”

# using Bash on Linux or Mac
dockerId=”<your-docker-id-goes-here>”

docker login --username $dockerId
```

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://dpzbhybb2pdcj.cloudfront.net/stoneman/v-1/Figures/image040.jpg">
</div>

```
docker image tag image-gallery $dockerId/image-gallery:v1
docker image ls --filter reference=image-gallery --filter reference=*/image-gallery
```



<div align="center">
    <img src="https://dpzbhybb2pdcj.cloudfront.net/stoneman/v-1/Figures/image041.jpg">
</div>

The docker image push command is the counterpart of the pull command, it uploads your local image layers to the registry:

```
docker image push $dockerId/image-gallery:v1
```

```
The push refers to repository [docker.io/sixeyed/image-gallery]
 c8c60e5dbe37: Pushed
 2caab880bb11: Pushed
 3fcd399f2c98: Pushed
 ...
 v1: digest: sha256:127d0ed6f7a8d1... size: 2296
```

Example my image: 
- https://hub.docker.com/r/keer2345/image-gallery
- https://hub.docker.com/layers/keer2345/image-gallery/v1/images/sha256-0701f23b385df82d8b1680d6cdf483ba5751e767b586eeee83957d590427f706

You can browse to Docker Hub now and check your image. The Docker Hub UI uses the same repository name format as image references, so you can work out the URL of your image from your account name.

This little script writes out the URL to your image’s page Docker Hub:

```
echo "https://hub.docker.com/r/$dockerId/image-gallery/tags"
```

When you browse to that URL you’ll see something like figure 5.4, showing the tags for your image and the last update time:

# 5.3   Running and using your own Docker registry
Docker maintains the core registry server on GitHub in the source code repository `docker/distribution`. It gives you the basic functionality to push and pull images, and it uses the same layer cache system as Docker Hub – but it doesn’t give you the Web UI you get with Hub. It is a super lightweight server which I've packaged into a `diamol` image, so you can run in a container.
```
docker container run -d -p 5000:5000 diamol/registry
```

This next command creates that alias, it will give your computer the name `registry.local`, in addition to any other network names it has. It does this by writing to the computer’s `hosts` file, which is a simple text file that links network names to IP addresses.
```
# using PowerShell on Windows
echo "`n127.0.0.1  registry.local" >> /windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts

# using Bash on Linux or Mac
echo $'\n127.0.0.1  registry.local' >> /etc/hosts
```
<div align="center">

</div>

```
docker image tag image-gallery registry.local:5000/gallery/ui:v1
```



Allowing an insecure registry to be used in Docker Desktop:

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://dpzbhybb2pdcj.cloudfront.net/stoneman/v-1/Figures/image044.jpg">
</div>

If you're not running Docker Desktop, then you'll do this manually. Start by opening the `daemon.json` file in a text editor - or create it if it doesn’t exist - and add the insecure registry details in JSON format. The configuration settings will look like this - but if you're editing an existing file, be sure to leave the original settings in there too:
```json
{
     "insecure-registries":  [
         "registry.local:5000"
     ]
 }
```

Then you restart Docker using `Restart-Service docker` on Windows Server, or `service docker restart` on Linux. You can check which insecure registries your Docker Engine allows along with a stack of other information using the info command.

List the information about your Docker Engine and check your registry is there in the insecure registries list:
```
docker info
```

Insecure registries allowed for Docker to use:

Push your tagged image:
```
docker image push registry.local:5000/gallery/ui:v1
```

# 5.4   Using image tags effectively
If you use the same approach with your image tags, you can let users choose whether to stick on a major version or a minor version, or just always have the latest release.
```
docker image tag image-gallery registry.local:5000/gallery/ui:latest
docker image tag image-gallery registry.local:5000/gallery/ui:2
docker image tag image-gallery registry.local:5000/gallery/ui:2.1
docker image tag image-gallery registry.local:5000/gallery/ui:2.1.106
```

# 5.5   Turning official images into golden images
Using a golden image to encapsulate an official image:

There are two Dockerfiles in the source code for this chapter which can be built as golden images for .NET Core apps. Browse to each folder and build the image:
```
cd ch05/exercises/dotnet-sdk
docker image build -t golden/dotnetcore-sdk:3.0 .

cd ../aspnet-runtime
docker image build -t golden/aspnet-core:3.0 .
```

A multi-stage Dockerfile using .NET Core golden images:
```
FROM golden/dotnetcore-sdk:3.0 AS builder
COPY . .
RUN dotnet publish -o /out/app app.csproj

FROM golden/aspnet-core:3.0
COPY --from=builder /out /app
CMD ["dotnet", "/app/app.dll"]
```
