# 2.1   Running Hello World in a container

</div>

It writes out some details about the computer it’s running on:
- The machine name, in this example `2cff9e95ce83`
- The operating system, in this example `Linux 4.9.125-linuxkit x86_64`
- The network address, in this example `172.17.0.3`

If you running a container using the same command:
```
docker container run diamol/ch02-hello-diamol
```
```
---------------------
 Hello from Chapter 2!
 ---------------------
 My name is:
 858a26ee2741
 ---------------------
 Im running on:
 Linux 4.9.125-linuxkit x86_64
 ---------------------
 My address is:
 inet addr:172.17.0.5 Bcast:172.17.255.255 Mask:255.255.0.0
```

Now my app is running on a machine with the name 858a26ee2741 and the IP address 172.17.0.5. The machine name will change every time, and the IP address will often change, but every container is running on the same computer.

# 2.2   So what is a container?
An app inside the container environment:

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://dpzbhybb2pdcj.cloudfront.net/stoneman/v-1/Figures/Images_01-03_7.jpg">
</div>

Those things are all virtual resources – the hostname, IP address and file system are created by Docker. They’re logical objects which are managed by Docker, and they’re all joined together to create an environment where an application can run. That’s the “box” of the container.

One thing is very important about containers - they have these separate environments, but they all share the CPU and memory of the computer, and they all share the computer’s Operating System – you can see in figure 2.3 how containers on the same computer are isolated:


<div align="center">
    <img src="https://dpzbhybb2pdcj.cloudfront.net/stoneman/v-1/Figures/Images_01-03_8.jpg">
</div>

VMs provide isolation at the cost of density. Multiple VMs on one computer each have their own OS:

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://dpzbhybb2pdcj.cloudfront.net/stoneman/v-1/Figures/Images_01-03_9.jpg">
</div>

Containers give you both. Each container shares the Operating System from the computer running the container, and that makes them extremely lightweight. Containers start quickly and run lean, so you can run many more containers than VMs on the same hardware - typically five to ten times as many. You get density, but each app is in its own container, so you get isolation too. That’s another key feature of Docker: efficiency. 

# 2.3   Connecting to a container like a remote computer
Run the following command in your terminal session:
```
docker container run --interactive --tty diamol/base
```

or
```
docker container run -it diamol/base
```

 Running an interactive container and connecting to the container’s terminal

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://dpzbhybb2pdcj.cloudfront.net/stoneman/v-1/Figures/Images_01-03_10.jpg">
</div>


Run the commands `hostname` and `date` and you’ll see details of the container’s environment:
```
/ # hostname
f1695de1f2ec
/ # date
Thu Jun 20 12:18:26 UTC 2019
```
Open up a new terminal session and you can get details of all the running containers with the command:
```
docker container ls
```
or
```
docker ps
```

`docker container top [ID | Container_Name]` lists the processes running in the container – I’m using `f1
` as a short form of the container ID `f1695de1f2ec`:

```
> docker container top f1
PID                 USER                TIME                COMMAND
69622               root                0:00                /bin/sh
```

`docker container logs` displays any log entries the container has collected:
```
> docker container logs f1
/ # hostname
f1695de1f2ec
```
Docker collects log entries using the output from the application in the container. In the case of this terminal session I see the commands I ran and their results, but for a real application you would see your code’s log entries. For example a Web application may write a log entry for every HTTP request processed, and these will show in the container logs.

`docker container inspect` shows you all the details of a container:
```
docker container inspect f1
```
```
> docker container inspect f1
[
    {
        "Id": "f1695de1f2ecd493d17849a709ffb78f5647a0bcd9d10f0d97ada0fcb7b05e98",
        "Created": "2019-06-20T12:13:52.8360567Z"

        # ...
```

The full output shows lots of low-level information including the paths of the container’s virtual filesystem, and the virtual Docker network the container is connected to. It comes as a large chunk of JSON, which is great for automating with scripts, but not so good for a code listing in a book – so I’ve just shown the first few lines.


Run `exit` to close the terminal session.
```
exit
```

# 2.4   Hosting a website in a container

Run `docker container ls --all` or `docker ps -a`, which shows all containers - in any status:
```
> docker container ls --all
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                     COMMAND                CREATED            STATUS   
f1695de1f2ec  diamol/base               "/bin/sh"              About an hour ago  Exited (0)
858a26ee2741  diamol/ch02-hello-diamol  "/bin/sh -c ./cmd.sh"  3 hours ago        Exited (0)
2cff9e95ce83  diamol/ch02-hello-diamol  "/bin/sh -c ./cmd.sh"  4 hours ago        Exited (0)
```
or
```
docker ps -a
```
- First: containers are only running while the application inside the container is running. As soon as the application process ends, the container goes into the exited state. _Exited containers don’t use any CPU time or memory_. The “Hello World” container exited automatically as soon as the script completed. The interactive container we were connected to exited as soon as we exited the terminal application.
- Second: containers don’t disappear when they exit. _Containers in the exited state still exist_, which means you can start them again, check the logs, and you can copy files to and from the container’s filesystem. You only see running containers with `docker container ls`, but Docker doesn’t remove exited containers unless you explicitly tell it to do so. Exited containers still take up space on disk, because their filesystem is kept on the computer’s disk.

So what about starting containers which stay in the background and just keep running? That’s actually the main use-case for Docker, running server applications like websites, batch processes and databases.

```docker
docker container run --detach --publish 8088:80 diamol/ch02-hello-diamol-web
```
or
```
docker container run -d -p 8088:80 diamol/ch02-hello-diamol-web
```
Run `docker container ls` and you’ll see that the new container has the status “Up”:
```docker
> docker container ls
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                                                        COMMAND                   CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                           NAMES
e53085ff0cc4        diamol/ch02-hello-diamol-web                                                 "bin\\httpd.exe -DFOR…"   52 seconds ago      Up 50 seconds       443/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8088->80/tcp   reverent_dubinsky
```

- `--detach` – starts the container in the background and shows the container ID
- `--publish` – publishes a port from the container to the computer

The physical and virtual networks for computers and containers:

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://dpzbhybb2pdcj.cloudfront.net/stoneman/v-1/Figures/Images_01-03_11.jpg">
</div>

Browse to `http://localhost:8088` on a browser. That’s an HTTP request to the local computer, but the response comes from the container:

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://dpzbhybb2pdcj.cloudfront.net/stoneman/v-1/Figures/Images_01-03_12.jpg">
</div>

`docker container stats` is another useful one, it shows a live view of how much CPU, memory, network and disk the container is using:
```
> docker container stats e53
 CONTAINER ID  NAME               CPU %  PRIV WORKING SET  NET I/O             BLOCK I/O      
 e53085ff0cc4  reverent_dubinsky  0.36%  16.88MiB          250kB / 53.2kB      19.4MB / 6.21MB
copy
```

or

```
docker stats e53
```

Run this command to remove all your containers:
```
docker container rm --force $(docker container ls --all --quiet)
```

# 2.5   Understanding how Docker runs containers
Workflow which is at the core of Docker:
- build
- share
- run

The components of Docker:

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://dpzbhybb2pdcj.cloudfront.net/stoneman/v-1/Figures/Images_01-03_13.jpg">
</div>

- The **Docker Engine** is the management component of Docker.
- The Docker Engine makes all the features available through the **Docker API**, which just a standard HTTP-based REST API. You can configure the Engine to make the API accessible only from the local computer (which is the default), or available to other computers on your network.
- The **Docker Command-Line Interface (CLI)** is a client of the Docker API. When you run docker commands, the CLI actually sends them to the Docker API and the Docker Engine does the work.

Docker Universal Control Plane, a graphical user interface for containers:

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://dpzbhybb2pdcj.cloudfront.net/stoneman/v-1/Figures/Images_01-03_14.jpg">
</div>


This is [Universal Control Plane (UCP)](https://docs.docker.com/ee/ucp/), a commercial product from the company behind Docker. Portainer is another option, which is an open-source project. Both UCP and [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/) run as containers themselves, so they’re easy to deploy and manage.

We won’t be diving any deeper into the Docker architecture than this. The Docker Engine uses a component called [containerd](https://containerd.io/) to actually manage containers, and containerd in turn makes use of Operating System features to create the virtual environment that is the container.

# 2.6   Lab: exploring the container filesystem
Every lab has a sample solution on the book’s GitHub repository. It’s really worth you spending some time trying it out yourself, but if you want to check my solution you can find it here:
- https://github.com/sixeyed/diamol/tree/master/ch02/lab

1. Run the web container from the chapter exercises:
```
> docker container run --detach --publish 8088:80 diamol/ch02-hello-diamol-web
86b20cd8e846d7ea8cf29d08d8c22118f925cca818ab28765d218c7585dbc52d
```
2. *[Optional]* Check the HTML page in the container is in the expected location:
- on Linux use the ls command:
```
> docker container exec 86b  ls /usr/local/apache2/htdocs
index.html
```
- on Windows use the dir command, but you need to wrap it in a cmd statement:
```
docker container exec 86b cmd /s /c dir C:\usr\local\apache2\htdocs
index.html
```
3. We know where the HTML file is inside the container, so we can use `docker container cp` to copy a local file into the container. This will overwrite the `index.html` file in the container with the file in my current directory:
```
docker container cp index.html 86b:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/index.html
```
4. Browse to the published port on `http://localhost:8088` - you'll see your new content:
<div align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sixeyed/diamol/master/ch02/lab/new-website.png">
</div>


Here are some hints to get you going:
- You can run `docker container` to get a list of all the actions you can perform on a container
- Add `--help` to any docker command and you’ll see more detailed help text
- In the `diamol/ch02-hello-diamol-web` Docker image, the content from the website is served from the directory `/usr/local/apache2/htdocs` (that’s `C:\usr\local\apache2\htdocs` on Windows).

Good luck :)
