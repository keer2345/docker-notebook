# 3.1   Using a container image from Docker Hub
Pull the container image for the web-ping application:
```
docker image pull diamol/ch03-web-ping
```

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://dpzbhybb2pdcj.cloudfront.net/stoneman/v-1/Figures/Images_01-03_15.jpg">
</div>

Docker Hub also has a Web interface, and you’ll find details about this image at https://hub.docker.com/r/diamol/ch03-web-ping.


Let’s run a container from the image and see what the app does:
```
docker container run -d --name web-ping diamol/ch03-web-ping
```

- The `-d` flag is a short form of `--detach`, so this container will run in the background.
- Unlike the website container we ran detached in Chapter 2, this one doesn’t accept incoming traffic so you don’t need to publish any ports.
- There’s one new flag in this command which is `--name`. You know that you can work with containers using the ID that Docker generates, but you can also give them a friendly name. This container is called `web-ping`, and you can use that name to refer to the container instead of the random ID.

Have a look at the logs from the application, which are being collected by Docker:
```
docker container logs web-ping
```
The web-ping container in action, sending constant traffic to my blog

</div>


Remove the existing container, and run a new one with a value specified for the TARGET environment variable:
```
docker rm -f web-ping
docker container run --env TARGET=google.com diamol/ch03-web-ping
```

A container from the same image, sending traffic to Google:

</div>

Docker images may be packaged with a default set of configuration values for the application, but you should be able to provide different configuration settings when you run a container.

Environment variables in Docker images and containers:

# 3.2   Writing your first Dockerfile
```
mkdir web-ping
touch Dockerfile app.js README.md
```
Code shows the full Dockerfile to package up the web-ping application:
```
FROM diamol/node

ENV TARGET="blog.sixeyed.com"
ENV METHOD="HEAD"
ENV INTERVAL="3000"

WORKDIR /web-ping
COPY app.js .

CMD ["node", "/web-ping/app.js"]
```

- `FROM` – every image has to start from another image.
- `ENV` – sets values for environment variables. The syntax is `[key]=”[value]”`
- `WORKDIR` – creates a directory in the container image file system, and sets that to be the current working directory.
- `COPY` – copies files or directories from the local filesystem into the container image.
- `CMD` – specifies the command to run when Docker starts a container from the image. 


```javascript
const https = require('https');

const options = {
    hostname: process.env.TARGET,
    method: process.env.METHOD
  };

console.log('** web-ping ** Pinging: %s; method: %s; %dms intervals', options.hostname, options.method, process.env.INTERVAL);
  
let i = 1;
let start = new Date().getTime();
setInterval(() => {    
    start = new Date().getTime();
    console.log('Making request number: %d; at %d', i++, start);
    var req = https.request(options, (res) => {
        var end = new Date().getTime();    
        var duration = end-start;    
        console.log('Got response status: %s at %d; duration: %dms', res.statusCode, end, duration);
    });
    req.on('error', (e) => {
        console.error(e);
      });
    req.end();
}, process.env.INTERVAL)
```

 The content you need to build the Docker image:

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://dpzbhybb2pdcj.cloudfront.net/stoneman/v-1/Figures/Images_01-03_19.jpg">
</div>

In this directory you have everything you need to build your own image for the web-ping application.

# 3.3   Building your own container image

Turn this Dockerfile into a Docker image by running `docker image build`:
```
docker image build --tag web-ping .
```

- The `--tag` argument is the name for the image.
- The final argument is the directory where the `Dockerfile` and related files are.

Output from building the web-ping Docker image:
<div align="center">
    <img src="https://dpzbhybb2pdcj.cloudfront.net/stoneman/v-1/Figures/Images_01-03_20.jpg">
</div>

```
docker image ls web-ping
```
```
REPOSITORY  TAG     IMAGE ID      CREATED          SIZE  
web-ping    latest  f2a5c430ab2a  14 minutes ago   75.3MB
```
Run a container from your own image to ping Docker’s website every five seconds:
```
docker container run -e TARGET=docker.com -e INTERVAL=5000 web-ping
```
Running the web-ping container from your own image:

</div>

# 3.4   Understanding Docker images and image layers
Check the history for your web-ping image:
```
docker image history web-ping
```
How image layers are logically built into Docker images:
<div align="center">
    <img src="https://dpzbhybb2pdcj.cloudfront.net/stoneman/v-1/Figures/Images_01-03_22.jpg">
</div>

If you don’t include a filter in the command, you’ll see all images:
```
docker image ls
```

Listing images to see their sizes:

</div>

The system df command shows exactly how much disk space Docker is using:
```
docker system df
```
Checking Docker’s disk space usage:

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://dpzbhybb2pdcj.cloudfront.net/stoneman/v-1/Figures/Images_01-03_24.jpg">
</div>

# 3.5   Optimizing Dockerfiles to use the image layer cache
Build a new version of your Docker image:
```
docker image build -t web-ping:v2 .
```
Building an image where layers can be used from the cache:

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://dpzbhybb2pdcj.cloudfront.net/stoneman/v-1/Figures/Images_01-03_25.png">
</div>

- The `CMD` instruction doesn’t need to be at the end of the Dockerfile, it can be anywhere after the `FROM` instruction and still have the same result.
- And one `ENV` instruction can be used to set multiple environment variables, so the three separate `ENV` instructions can be combined.

The optimized Dockerfile is shown:
```
FROM diamol/node

CMD ["node", "/web-ping/app.js"]

ENV TARGET="blog.sixeyed.com" \
    METHOD="HEAD" \
    INTERVAL="3000"

WORKDIR /web-ping
COPY app.js .
```

```
docker image build -t web-ping:v3 .
```

# 3.6   Lab
There’s a sample solution on the book’s GitHub repository if you need it, you’ll find it here:

- https://github.com/sixeyed/diamol/tree/master/ch03/lab

Here are some hints to get you going:
- Remember the `-it` flags let you run to a container interactively
- The filesystem for a container still exists when it is exited
- There are lots of commands you haven’t used yet. `docker container --help` will show you two that could help you solve the lab.
