# What is Docker?
## "Hello, World"
```
docker run dockerinaction/hello_world
```

## Containers
With Docker, users get containers at a much lower cost. As Docker and its container engines improve, you get the latest and greatest isolation features. Instead of keeping up with the rapidly evolving and highly technical world of building strong containers, you can let Docker handle the bulk of that for you.

## Containers are not virtualization
## Running software in containers for isolation

Docker builds containers using ten major system features.
1. **_PID namespace_** — Process identifiers and capabilities
1. **_UTS namespace_** — Host and domain name
1. **_MNT namespace_** — File system access and structure
1. **_IPC namespace_** — Process communication over shared memory
1. **_NET namespace_** — Network access and structure
1. **_USR namespace_** — User names and identifiers
1. `chroot()` — Controls the location of the file system root
1. _cgroups_ — Resource protection
1. _CAP drop_ — Operating system feature restrictions
1. _Security Modules_ — Mandatory access controls

While Docker uses those to build containers at runtime, it uses another set of technologies to package and ship containers.

## Shipping containers
The component that fills the shipping container role is called an **image**.

# What problems does Docker solve?
Things are only made more complicated when applications share dependencies:
- What happens if one application needs an upgraded dependency but the other does not?
- What happens when you remove an application? Is it really gone?
- Can you remove old dependencies?
- Can you remember all the changes you had to make to install the software you now want to remove?

## Getting organized
**Figure 1.5** illustrates how example applications depend on example libraries without Docker.

## Improving portability
## Protecting your computer
There are all sorts of ways that a program might misbehave or present a security risk:
- A program might have been written specifically by an attacker.
- Well-meaning developers could write a program with harmful bugs.
- A program could accidentally do the bidding of an attacker through bugs in its input handling.

# Why is Docker important?
1. Docker is important because it makes containers available to everyone. Using it saves time, money, and energy.
1. The second reason Docker is important is that there is significant push in the software community to adopt containers and Docker.
1. The third reason Docker is important is that it has accomplished for the computer what app stores did for mobile devices.
1. Fourth, we’re finally starting to see better adoption of some of the more advanced isolation features of operating systems.
